# SAS Solutions

This repository provides all the resources, templates, and automation necessary to create and deploy a SAS solution environment on an AKS cluster using an **Azure Service Catalog Managed Application Definition (SCMAD)**. The **SCMAD** enables users to provision a SAS solution deployment in a dedicated Azure subscription.

Currently, this repository supports the following combinations:

|SAS solution              |Cadence           |AKS Kubernetes Version|
